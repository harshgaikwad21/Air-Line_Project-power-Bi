## 📊 Project Summary

This repository contains a Power BI template (.pbit) designed for creating an Airlines Analytics Dashboard. The template includes a prebuilt report structure, custom visuals, and an optimized data model to help users analyze key airline performance metrics. By loading your dataset into the template, you can instantly generate insights related to airline operations, flight performance, passenger trends, and business outcomes.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Template

**1. Well-Structured Report Layout**

The template includes predefined:

  - Report pages

  - Visual layouts

  - Interactive charts

  - KPI cards and slicers

Multiple visual.json and page.json files indicate a professionally organized dashboard with multiple insights panels.

**2. Optimized Data Model**

The included DataModelSchema file suggests:

  - Clean relationships

  - Predefined measures (DAX)

  - Calculated columns

  - Standardized formatting

This model allows the dashboard to function seamlessly once the user connects their own data source.

**3. Custom Themes & Branding**

The presence of:

  - Custom theme JSON files

  - Multiple logo image files

shows that the dashboard uses a polished visual theme for a consistent and professional UI experience.

**4. Interactive & Insight-Rich Visual**

The visual definitions imply coverage of high-value aviation metrics such as:

  - Flight delays & cancellations

  - Passenger traffic trends

  - Route popularity

  - On-time performance

  - Revenue and load factor trends

  - Airport or airline comparisons

These insights empower airline analysts and decision-makers.

**5. Reusable & Scalable Template**

Because this is a .pbit file, users can:

  - Load new datasets

  - Retain all visuals and structure

  - Refresh and generate insights instantly

This makes it perfect for recurring analysis or enterprise reporting.

## 📌 Short Insights

- The dashboard shows **15K total flights**, with the majority being **On-Time**. Delayed and Cancelled flights form a much smaller portion.

- Total **Delay Minutes exceed 1M**, indicating operational delays are still a significant factor despite most flights being punctual.

- **Aircraft Type count by Destination** shows **JFK, DEL, and BOM** as the busiest destinations with the highest aircraft type activity.

- Airlines such as **Air India, Lufthansa, Emirates, Qatar Airways, IndiGo, and United Airlines** are included, allowing comparison across major carriers.

- The date slicer (2023–2025) allows users to dynamically explore trends across multiple years.

 ## 📌 Short Insights

- Across all major origins (BLR, BOM, DEL, DOH, DXB, FRA, JFK, LHR), **On-Time flights dominate**, consistently showing the highest count compared to delayed or cancelled flights.

- **Delayed flights** form a small but visible portion across all origins, while cancelled flights remain minimal.

- The latest recorded status on the dashboard shows **“On Time”**, indicating stable operational performance.

- The map visualization highlights flight activity across **North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia**, with most statuses marked as On-Time across regions.

- The detailed table for Departure and Arrival times supports analysis of schedule adherence and operational patterns for selected origins.

## 📌 Short Insights

- **Average delay minutes across all aircraft types are very similar**, ranging between **88–90 minutes**, showing consistent delay patterns regardless of aircraft model (A320, B787, A380, B737, B777).

- **A320 appears as the first aircraft type for all listed airlines**, suggesting it is the most commonly used aircraft among major carriers like Air India, Emirates, IndiGo, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, and United Airlines.

- **Average delay by origin also shows very little variation**, with all airports (DXB, FRA, DOH, DEL, BLR, JFK, LHR, BOM) recording delays in the **high 80s to low 90s**.

- The consistency in both aircraft-type and origin-based delays suggests **system-wide operational delays** rather than issues tied to specific planes or airports.

## 📌 Short Insights

- **Total Flights**: About **15K flights** are recorded in the selected period.

- **On-Time Performance**: Majority of flights (**75% / 11.22K**) are **On Time**, while **20%** are delayed and **5%** canceled.

- **Top Origins: LHR, DXB, BLR, DOH, DEL, BOM** each contribute a similar volume (~1.8K–1.9K flights).

- **Top Destinations: FRA, BLR, DEL, JFK, DXB, BOM** receive the most flights, with FRA being highlighted.

- **Aircraft Mix**: Most common aircraft types include **A380, B777, B787, B737, A320**, with counts ranging from 41–58 each.

- **Date Range**: Dashboard covers flights from **01 January 2023** onward.
