## 📊 Project Summary

This repository contains a Power BI template (.pbit) designed for creating an Airlines Analytics Dashboard. The template includes a prebuilt report structure, custom visuals, and an optimized data model to help users analyze key airline performance metrics. By loading your dataset into the template, you can instantly generate insights related to airline operations, flight performance, passenger trends, and business outcomes.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Template

**1. Well-Structured Report Layout**

The template includes predefined:

  - Report pages

  - Visual layouts

  - Interactive charts

  - KPI cards and slicers

**2. Optimized Data Model**

The included DataModelSchema file suggests:

  - Clean relationships

  - Predefined measures (DAX)

  - Calculated columns

  - Standardized formatting

This model allows the dashboard to function seamlessly once the user connects their own data source.

**3. Custom Themes & Branding**

The presence of:
